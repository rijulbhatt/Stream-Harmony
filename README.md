"Stream Harmony": A Revolutionary AI-Driven Comment-Scoring System 
• Utilizes advanced technologies like sentiment analysis and machine learning to assign 
numerical scores based on user comments. 
• Scores serve as a metric for user engagement, ranging from positive to negative. 
• Streamers can set precise thresholds for comment scores during live streams. 
• The system aims to foster a positive community ambiance during live broadcasts. 
• Stream Harmony combines technological innovation and social enhancement, reshaping 
digital streaming engagement.

Objectives:

Real-Time Comment Scoring System: 
o Design and implement a system for live comment analysis using NLP techniques. 
o Train a machine learning model to classify comments based on criteria like 
sentiment, relevance, and toxicity. 
o Generate scores for each comment in real time. 

Streamer Control: 
o Enable streamers to set a minimum score threshold for comment participation. 
o Integrate the scoring system into the streaming platform to automatically restrict 
commenting privileges for users below the threshold. 

Fair and Unbiased Moderation: 
o Implement robust data collection and training methods to mitigate potential 
biases. 
o Monitor and address bias drift over time through regular re-evaluation and 
adjustments. 

Transparency and User Control: 
o Inform users about the system's purpose, data collection practices, and 
consequences of low scores. 
o Provide users with mechanisms to appeal scores and request manual review by 
human moderators.
